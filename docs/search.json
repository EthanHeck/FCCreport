    "text": "Who the Heck am I?\nTo begin, well, here is an image of me at TQL Stadium against Atlanta United when we were still under the reign of Tyrone Marshall, who was the interim following the mighty Jaap Stam (I am a United fan). This was on fan appreciation day, the last game of the season, mind you. I got to witness the passing of the greatest trophy in MLS: The Wooden Spoon.\nAll jokes aside, this was my first game in person. My father, who isn’t a fan of soccer, asked what significance the spoon had, so I promptly explained that it was a sign of failure. All that to say, I have been a fan for a few years and am not just a glory hunter, haha.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyways, a bit more about me from a footy perspective. I am a proud Manchester United fan and have been for what feels like 10 long years (I know we are currently 15th). For the first 6-7 years of my football fandom, I was what many would call a “Euro Snob”—that is, I only cared to watch the European leagues and deemed MLS an inferior, poor-quality league.\nWhile yes, the quality of the Premier League is some of, if not the best, in the world, I realized that many claims against MLS were baseless. Despite what many say, the league has clubs with deep-rooted fan culture that is not simply plastic American franchise-style culture. I also realized that while older players do come to the league in the twilight of their careers, many young players build their careers here (Chris Richards, Tanner Tessmann, etc.) and now play for notable teams in Europe.\nI finally realized that though the rest of the world deems our culture “cringe” and our chants lacking, this is our league. It is the league I am geographically closest to, and it is what we have. Despite its issues (broadcasting, DP rules, etc.), MLS is improving year after year. Cincinnati is the team closest to me, and I had grown up going to Reds games and loving the city. The choice to support FCC was easy, despite their on-field performance at the time.\nCurrently, I am a Master’s student in Biostatistics. I spend most of my time writing mathematical code inside a programming language known as R. I have always wanted a way to express my thoughts on the game I love but never quite found the right outlet. This site lies at the intersection of my educational and professional goals and my passion for footy.\n\n\nWhat to Expect?\nI plan on posting match reports with plots I create inside R each week, diving into the team’s performance in past games. I am currently working on the report for our home opener vs. NYRB right now and hope to have it up before our next match on Wednesday. The depth of the reports may vary week to week as the semester ebbs and flows.\nIf you choose to read the reports, I hope you enjoy! All for Cincy!

    "text": "FC Cinicinatti 1 - NY Red Bulls 0: Breakdown\nThis breakdown will take a look at orange and blue’s home opener against NYRB. To begin, I want to discuss the non-footy things such as the new signings, buildup to the match, fan atmosphere, etc.\n\n\nNew Signings\nObviously, these two marque singings need no introduction. Kevin Denkey and Evander are players who are known for their class on the ball. Denkey scored 23 in 28 appearances in the 2023/24 season with his previous club, Cercle Brugge. Already this season, he has hit the ground running for the orange and blue netting 2 in 2 games. He is currently listed as +2500 to win the golden boot, which could be a huge under-estimation of his ability come the end of the season.\nEvander, like Denkey, is a player who is known to be great with more potential to grow as he is only 26 years old. He comes to Cincy with nice experience in the MLS and abroad, where he even played in the UEFA Champions League in his time at FC Midtjylland. Last season while playing for the Portland Timbers, he had 34 goal contributions which put him second to a little known player by the name of Lionel Messi (haha).\nAll this to say, both signings have started well. I look forward to seeing these two form chemistry as the season progresses. I also love that this ownership group has shown a willingness to invest and obtain the best players to help us push towards an MLS cup or Concacaf Champions League.\n#The Game Itself I was lucky enough to attend this game and before the game even began, the atmosphere was amazing. At the time of kickoff, the temperature was a cold 30-ish degrees but this did not tamper the fans, especially in the Bailey, even for a moment. The night began with an amazing firework display, where one of the techs even took a firework to the face (whom I hope is okay), and a nice tifo from the Bailey that read “Let the wild rumpus start”.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, diving a bit into the tactics on the day, we saw FCC line up in a 5-3-2 that tends to shift in a sword type formation in an 5-3-1-1. As expected, the team looked a bit rusty in the first half especially and it was clear that the players haven’t quite gelled yet (as is expected this early in the season with a new number 10 and 9). Over the next few games, the team will continue to get used to see Evander dropping into the half spaces to link up play instead of looking for Lucho in that role. They will also adjust to Denkey up top and how to best utlilize his abilites. Early on in this game, Denkey recieved a through ball and nearly scored the first goal of the season but was ultimately stopped by the woodwork. He later found his breakthrough with a beautiful pass from Deandre Yedlin from around midfield which he headed precisely over Carlos Coronel. The ggplot below represents this goal.\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\nWarning: The `size` argument of `element_rect()` is deprecated as of ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use the `linewidth` argument instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nAs we look forward to Motagua (Wednesday) and Philidelphia (Saturday) with a potential massive matchup again Tigres next week, I took a lot of positives from this game. Yes at times it was sloppy, the build up play was not as smooth as one would like to see, but it was the first game. As I stated above, gelling will take time especially with the abscence of the main conductor offensively for the past few years. However, I believe that Evander is more than capable of filling this role and forming an amazing partnership with Kevin Denkey. I am rushing to get this first report up before tomorrow’s game against Motagua and spent a majority of my spare time getting the site launched and creating a function to produce the plots above. That being said, I will produce more tables/plots showing off that previous games stats as I develop a nice workflow for these reports. # Next game prediction FC Cincinatti 3 - Motagua 1, Bring on Tigres!\n\n\nGoodbye!\nAs always, if you read this report, thanks so much for stoping by. All for Cincy!"
