    "section": "",
    "text": "Im back!\nFirst and foremost, I had midterms over the last couple of weeks and could not clear time to create reports for the last few games. But really, besides the Toronto win, there haven’t been too many great things to report, sadly. This first report back will not be as analytical graphics-wise, as I am still currently trying to find something to create my own niche to offer something meaningful outside of regurgitating stats that can be found on FotMob or FBref. Not sure what exactly I want to do yet, but I am working on it!\nI also updated the site a bit—the name changed, and I put the FCC reports in their own tabs simply so that I could still chuck random things about other footy topics (Ted Lasso, best formation, how crap the Glazers are, etc.) onto this site without it being such a far deviation from the norm. However, the orange and blue are still my primary focus!\n\n\nFCC vs Toronto\nIt’s been nearly 10 days since we played this game, so my fresh thoughts are a bit gone at this point, but the overarching themes still remain. The biggest point of this game was the switch to the back four, which was a changeup from Noonan’s normal back three/five system. The back four was Engle, Hadebe, Robinson (plz be okay), and Powell. We played really well this game, with 12 shots and 6 on target versus Toronto’s 6 shots and 1 on target.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it did take until a penalty was scored by Denkey in the 73rd minute to break the deadlock, which was followed up by a well-taken goal from Yuya Kubo in the 87th minute. The goal by Kubo was particularly nice because it came from a quick break in our own half, with a nice back-heel pass from Bucha to Evander, who played an amazing first-time ball into the path of Kubo, who slotted the ball into the far corner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll in all, the Tornoto match was a great performance from the boys in orange and blue, and really filled me with confidence as we moved into the Tigres second leg.\n\n\nTigres Leg 2: Tigres 3 - FCC 1\nThis game started amazingly for FCC. As that goal went in from Evander in the 18th minute, I started to believe we could advance and really give the competition a go this season. The first half from FCC was great—we controlled play, held our own throughout the half, and limited Tigres to only a few half chances.\nHowever, going into the second half, Tigres came out as a completely different team, instantly applying pressure and keeping us pinned within our own half, fighting to stay in the lead. Tigres finally found a breakthrough in the 64th minute through Herrera, at which point I hoped we could regroup and keep ourselves in the tie. I was quickly disappointed as, in the 69th minute, we conceded again with a goal from Brunetta. At this point, we needed to score again to stay in the tie, and instead of scoring, we conceded yet another to Tigres in the 72nd minute with a goal from Ibáñez. This eight-minute stretch sent us out of the CCL and left us with one less trophy to take home this season.\nGiven the result, I really do not have the desire to make us look at three-goal plots from Tigres since we all know how bad that was—around 12 a.m. EST, Tigres turned into prime Barça and scored three in eight minutes to send us home. That half was disastrously bad and is one I want to forget. It sends us out of the CCL, yes, but maybe it can be viewed in a positive light as it will decrease the fixture load and (hopefully) help our squad stay healthy. It was also nice to see an Evander goal, but those are about the only positives at this point.\n\n\nCharlotte FC 2 - FCC 0\nIn what some call the Queen City Derby, I really wanted to see FCC take a result against Zaha and co. For one, just because FCC deserves the Queen City name for various reasons, and two, to beat Wilfried Zaha.\nFocusing only on Zaha alone, we played quite well in that respect. Anyone who has watched the EPL over the last 10 or so years would know the kind of threat Zaha presents. The first few minutes of the game were insanely back and forth, with both teams creating chances but neither converting.\nGoing into the second half, we looked in this game with a chance for at least a point, if not three. In the first minutes of the half (47th minute), Orellano had an incredible shot on goal that was set for the top left corner, requiring a great save from Kahlina. Within the same minute, Charlotte broke quickly with two through on our goal due to poor passing at the back when trying to control a Charlotte clearance, resulting in an easy goal for Abada. Three minutes later, in the 50th, Charlotte doubled their lead from a nice through ball into the feet of Agyemang, who was being marked by Flores at the time.\nIt’s also important to note that Miles Robinson had to be subbed early in the game due to some form of muscle injury (non-contact). Thankfully, the injury doesn’t seem to be severe in any way, and he should return to help the backline soon.\nThe highlight of the game (nearly) from an FCC point of view came in the 71st minute after we had managed to create a few chances when Evander hit a beautiful free kick headed toward the left corner of Charlotte’s goal, only to be denied by the woodwork. This is the sort of goal that, had it gone in, from a momentum standpoint within this game, we may have gone on to secure a point with roughly 20 minutes left to score one more. However, it wasn’t to be on the day, leaving us going into the Atlanta United fixture off a 2-0 loss.\n\n\nLooking ahead to Atlanta\nAtlanta is also coming off a loss at the hands of Messi and co. and is in a similar position to us in that they spent decently in the summer window with signings such as Almirón and Latte Lath but haven’t quite hit their stride four games into the season (who has? It’s early).\nThe biggest story in this game will be our backline due to injuries plus the suspension of Flores for his red card against Charlotte. Atlanta will definitely look to exploit what has been an unsteady backline this season, and Latte Lath will likely get a few chances on goal.\nTo win or draw this game, I think we need to score at least two goals. Denkey will miss out due to international break, which will hurt our attacking threat going forward (one reason the MLS calendar is so hated). Even with his absence, I believe we can still get goals, but the hardest part will be containing ATL. If I am forced to predict this game, I would sadly predict a 3-1 ATL win.\nAs always, thanks for reading and All for Cincy. Cheers!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Well, that happened…\nNot sure really where to start. Going to keep this one quick as it is 10:02 PM and I have a midterm to study for. So, sadly, no in-depth graphs or analysis this time, but not sure what we could dive into that goes beyond some surface issues in this game.\nThe first and most obvious issue is one that I don’t know that anyone (Noonan or players) can help. We have played four games in 11 days, which would put strain on any team, much less one like ours, whose backline is struggling to recover from injury with key pieces missing. Long story short, we need Miazga back ASAP, as well as Nick Hagglund. Philadelphia realized we were thin at the back with inexperienced players and targeted the backline as a way to get goals in this game, which proved to be a great plan. They struck early, and we never really recovered after that. I would make goal plots, but I know none of us Cincy fans want to look at four plots of Union goals.\nTo add to this “lots of games in a few days” issue, we have Tigres at home Tuesday, who are no easy opponent in any situation, much less for a team still trying to gel with each other and figure out how to play without Acosta on top of all of our current injuries. Another miss for the squad is Luca, who should return soon and inject some much-needed quality depth into the team. On the Tigres game, we would have hoped that our best players could have been subbed early in this one to rest for Tuesday, but both Denkey and Evander went the full 90. Both players had a chance, with Evander converting despite it being the less ideal of the two. These two will learn to gel with each other and the team as a whole more as the season progresses.\nBeyond injury/fixture congestion, we just didn’t show up. This was a time when Noonan’s squad looked sort of disjointed, with no real cohesiveness in buildup play, especially in the midfield. This could, in part, be due to starting two DMs, which inhibits the team’s ability to really progress the ball. We also never really won the midfield battle in this one. Union tended to smother us when in possession, win it back in the midfield areas, and quickly break with their three-headed attack.\nAnother low point of this match was Kubo, who can’t quite seem to find his footing this season. He seems to be struggling to make any real impact, and I am not certain what is causing this issue. Maybe the combination of a new 10 and 9 to play alongside in the attack is taking some adjustment, but I hope he returns to form soon. One positive note for me was Corey Baird, who played a few nice passes when coming on and got into some dangerous positions. He can sometimes struggle with the end product, but if he can find form and confidence, he will be a big piece for our trophy push this season.\nAll in all, this is a game that we can and should move on from quickly. It’s only the second league game of the season, and given the additions/injuries to our squad, it’s understandable that the game went the way it did. We all would have loved to march into Noonan/Albright’s old ground and take all three points (or even one for that matter), but we just could not compete on the day. I do not think there is any real reason to panic or be concerned based on this game alone. Hopefully, we can bounce back with a solid performance against Tigres and come into our full potential as we start to get key pieces back and Evander and Denkey continue to build their partnership.\nTo add insult to injury, United fell out of the FA Cup today on pens to Fulham. Not sure where the club is heading, but I am not sure anyone is—including the Glazers and INEOS.\nAnyways, let’s get a nice result Tuesday and move on from this game! ALL FOR CINCY! Thanks for reading and cheers!"

    "text": "Who the Heck am I?\nTo begin, well, here is an image of me at TQL Stadium against Atlanta United when we were still under the reign of Tyrone Marshall, who was the interim following the mighty Jaap Stam (I am a United fan). This was on fan appreciation day, the last game of the season, mind you. I got to witness the passing of the greatest trophy in MLS: The Wooden Spoon.\nAll jokes aside, this was my first game in person. My father, who isn’t a fan of soccer, asked what significance the spoon had, so I promptly explained that it was a sign of failure. All that to say, I have been a fan for a few years and am not just a glory hunter, haha.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyways, a bit more about me from a footy perspective. I am a proud Manchester United fan and have been for what feels like 10 long years (I know we are currently 15th). For the first 6-7 years of my football fandom, I was what many would call a “Euro Snob”—that is, I only cared to watch the European leagues and deemed MLS an inferior, poor-quality league.\nWhile yes, the quality of the Premier League is some of, if not the best, in the world, I realized that many claims against MLS were baseless. Despite what many say, the league has clubs with deep-rooted fan culture that is not simply plastic American franchise-style culture. I also realized that while older players do come to the league in the twilight of their careers, many young players build their careers here (Chris Richards, Tanner Tessmann, etc.) and now play for notable teams in Europe.\nI finally realized that though the rest of the world deems our culture “cringe” and our chants lacking, this is our league. It is the league I am geographically closest to, and it is what we have. Despite its issues (broadcasting, DP rules, etc.), MLS is improving year after year. Cincinnati is the team closest to me, and I had grown up going to Reds games and loving the city. The choice to support FCC was easy, despite their on-field performance at the time.\nCurrently, I am a Master’s student in Biostatistics. I spend most of my time writing mathematical code inside a programming language known as R. I have always wanted a way to express my thoughts on the game I love but never quite found the right outlet. This site lies at the intersection of my educational and professional goals and my passion for footy.\n\n\nWhat to Expect?\nI plan on posting match reports with plots I create inside R each week, diving into the team’s performance in past games. I am currently working on the report for our home opener vs. NYRB right now and hope to have it up before our next match on Wednesday. The depth of the reports may vary week to week as the semester ebbs and flows.\nIf you choose to read the reports, I hope you enjoy! All for Cincy!

    "text": "FC Cinicinatti 1 - NY Red Bulls 0: Breakdown\nThis breakdown will take a look at orange and blue’s home opener against NYRB. To begin, I want to discuss the non-footy things such as the new signings, buildup to the match, fan atmosphere, etc.\n\n\nNew Signings\nObviously, these two marque singings need no introduction. Kevin Denkey and Evander are players who are known for their class on the ball. Denkey scored 23 in 28 appearances in the 2023/24 season with his previous club, Cercle Brugge. Already this season, he has hit the ground running for the orange and blue netting 2 in 2 games. He is currently listed as +2500 to win the golden boot, which could be a huge under-estimation of his ability come the end of the season.\nEvander, like Denkey, is a player who is known to be great with more potential to grow as he is only 26 years old. He comes to Cincy with nice experience in the MLS and abroad, where he even played in the UEFA Champions League in his time at FC Midtjylland. Last season while playing for the Portland Timbers, he had 34 goal contributions which put him second to a little known player by the name of Lionel Messi (haha).\nAll this to say, both signings have started well. I look forward to seeing these two form chemistry as the season progresses. I also love that this ownership group has shown a willingness to invest and obtain the best players to help us push towards an MLS cup or Concacaf Champions League.\n#The Game Itself I was lucky enough to attend this game and before the game even began, the atmosphere was amazing. At the time of kickoff, the temperature was a cold 30-ish degrees but this did not tamper the fans, especially in the Bailey, even for a moment. The night began with an amazing firework display, where one of the techs even took a firework to the face (whom I hope is okay), and a nice tifo from the Bailey that read “Let the wild rumpus start”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, diving a bit into the tactics on the day, we saw FCC line up in a 5-3-2 that tends to shift in a sword type formation in an 5-3-1-1. As expected, the team looked a bit rusty in the first half especially and it was clear that the players haven’t quite gelled yet (as is expected this early in the season with a new number 10 and 9). Over the next few games, the team will continue to get used to see Evander dropping into the half spaces to link up play instead of looking for Lucho in that role. They will also adjust to Denkey up top and how to best utlilize his abilites. Early on in this game, Denkey recieved a through ball and nearly scored the first goal of the season but was ultimately stopped by the woodwork. He later found his breakthrough with a beautiful pass from Deandre Yedlin from around midfield which he headed precisely over Carlos Coronel. The ggplot below represents this goal.\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\nWarning: The `size` argument of `element_rect()` is deprecated as of ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use the `linewidth` argument instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nAs we look forward to Motagua (Wednesday) and Philidelphia (Saturday) with a potential massive matchup again Tigres next week, I took a lot of positives from this game. Yes at times it was sloppy, the build up play was not as smooth as one would like to see, but it was the first game. As I stated above, gelling will take time especially with the abscence of the main conductor offensively for the past few years. However, I believe that Evander is more than capable of filling this role and forming an amazing partnership with Kevin Denkey. I am rushing to get this first report up before tomorrow’s game against Motagua and spent a majority of my spare time getting the site launched and creating a function to produce the plots above. That being said, I will produce more tables/plots showing off that previous games stats as I develop a nice workflow for these reports. # Next game prediction FC Cincinatti 3 - Motagua 1, Bring on Tigres!\n\n\nGoodbye!\nAs always, if you read this report, thanks so much for stoping by. All for Cincy!"

Denkey will miss out due to international break, which will hurt our attacking threat going forward (one reason the MLS calendar is so hated). Even with his absence, I believe we can still get goals, but the hardest part will be containing ATL. If I am forced to predict this game, I would sadly predict a 3-1 ATL win.\nAs always, thanks for reading and All for Cincy. Cheers!"

    "text": "Erm, is the Concacaf Champions League this niche?\nA bit of a side note before diving in—I went to pull the stats for this game from FBref, and it seems there is zero report of the match against Motagua. Wild. Anyway, this gives me more time to develop a nice pipeline to prep for the Philadelphia game on Saturday after finishing this report. So, no crazy nice graphs in this one (sorry), but I’m sure we’d all rather keep this brief and move on to Tigres anyway!\n\n\nBreakdown\nThe talk leading up to this game was first focused around the starting XI. We saw players like Louro get a start (who made a couple of really nice saves), as well as Adnan and Daley. We lined up in the classic Noonan sword 5-2-2-1, with Denkey up top. The game began as a bit of a cagey affair for the first few minutes, but Motagua broke it open in the 9th minute with a cross from the right, which was finished off by their target man, Auzmendi. The goal resulted from a lapse at the back by Adnan, who allowed Auzmendi to break free for an easy one-on-one finish inside the box. Adnan was one player who failed to impress me on the day. The goal is shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, FCC replied with a goal of their own through none other than Kevin Denkey in the 18th minute, when the ball was won back in the midfield by Anuga and eventually ended up at the feet of Denkey by way of a great run by Corey Baird.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther than that, the game featured a few half-chances, with Louro making some excellent saves. Amir Daley and Kenji Mboma Dem were among the players who made their first-team debuts. Daley impressed me in a wingback-type role, showing solid defensive awareness against Motagua’s pacey wingers while also looking comfortable going forward. Mboma Dem and Adnan, both FCC 2 players, stepped up for some valuable first-team experience in this match.It is not being reported by Laurel Pfahler that Daley has a broken clavicle and will be out for 6-8 weeks. Hopefully throughout his recovery process he can develop a nice relationship with Yedlin that can help him as he continues to move into a first team role.\n\n\nFinal thoughts + Early Tigres Thoughts\nOverall, this game felt like a continuation of the team’s gelling process, much like we saw in the opener against NYRB. However, there were some really nice passages of link-up play between the midfield and Denkey, highlighted by some brilliant backheels from Evander once again. This was the kind of match you just have to win and move on from, and that’s exactly what we did. The FCC 2 players didn’t stand out as much as we might have hoped, but that’s understandable given their lack of experience at this level.\nTigres presents a much tougher challenge in the Round of 16, and I expect a scrappy match. One advantage for FCC is that Tigres will have to travel to TQL first next Tuesday, with their game against Philadelphia sandwiched in between. It’ll be interesting to see how we manage squad rotation across the upcoming MLS and CCL fixtures as the season begins to take shape. This Tigres game offers us the change to guage ourselves against some high level concacaf competition. It allows us as a team to see where we stack up to a solid Liga MX side and see how the MLS as a league has improved.\nI’m happy to see us advance and hopeful that our run doesn’t end here. Looking at our finalized roster, we’re more than capable of competing for silverware this season!\nLooking forward to Saturday’s matchup with the Union, I expect this game to be high scoring. Given our backline is still dealing with a few injuries and the talent they have coming forward, I expect them to net a few. That being said, I completely expect us to net a few as well given the attacking talent this team has already shown this season. I am very interested to see who will get subbed and when, and how Noonan choses to manage the squad for this match with the Tigres match looming on Tuesday. I predict a 3-2 Cincy win with a Denkey brace.\nAs always, thanks for reading, and be sure to check back Monday for the Philadelphia Union match report. ALL FOR CINCY! Cheers!"

    "text": "Well that’s a great start\nThis game started off in flying colors for the orange and blue, with a beautifully setup (Denkey) goal for none other than Pavel Bucha. It was a nice bit of play on the edge of the box between Yedlin with holdup play from Denkey who laid the ball of nicely for Bucha to nestle into the bottom corner in only the 3rd minute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the next 10-ish minutes, we looked really solid and were holding possession, which we were able to convert into some nice chances. However, in the 16th minute, Tigres leveled the game through a high, looping cross that came in from the byline and found the head of Nicolás Ibáñez, who rose over Hadebe to level the game at 1-1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, only a few minutes later, through some very nice buildup from the midfield, FCC carved out a beautiful chance that fell to Denkey inside the box with a good amount of space. I couldn’t have wished for this chance to fall to anyone else on the pitch, but we missed the opportunity for a swift reply when Denkey put the ball wide.\nAgain, in the 35th minute, through some bad play at the back from Tigres, Denkey was through on goal once more. It wasn’t as great of a chance this time, and he was unable to convert. Tigres also had a nice chance in the 35th minute that was nicely dealt with by Celentano.\nThe rest of the game was cagey, with good chances from Evander on the edge of the box around the 60th minute and from Orellano, who finally returned to the squad with a solid 30-minute stint in the second half. Sadly, the game ended in a 1-1 draw, and Cincy will head into next week’s fixture in San Nicolás, Mexico. #Thoughts + a bit of midfield analysis First, here’s a graph to show the midfield breakdown for Evander vs Tigres.\n\n\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n    /var/folders/vb/k5wntqvd6pv2ms6zbl61rq9w0000gn/T//RtmpizbW1l/downloaded_packages\n\n\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n    /var/folders/vb/k5wntqvd6pv2ms6zbl61rq9w0000gn/T//RtmpizbW1l/downloaded_packages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI wanted to key in on Evander (who I hope is okay and should be after he took a hard hit from a TIGRES player), not because he played poorly, but simply because I think he is the key going forward. His ability to pull players in on the flanks, like spreading passes out to Yedlin for a cross, or his ability to find Denkey with a quick flick or backheel is immense, and I really hope we see more of that in the future. The quicker he and Denkey can click, the better this team can become. I also think the re-integration (Severance haha) of Orellano back into the side will help provide another quality option in the attack.\nI compared his stats in this game to his average last season, not because it necessarily makes the most analytical sense to do so—because it does not—but because it shows his potential. If I am remembering correctly, he was second only to Messi in goal contributions last season. Now, combine that with Denkey’s ability + Orellano, and we can be a serious contender for any trophy.\nThat being said, to have a shot at continuing our push towards the CCL trophy, we have a tough assignment Tuesday in Mexico. It was always going to be difficult playing on the road in what will be a raucous environment, but with the away goal rule, it becomes even more of a hill to climb. However, we can do it. We will just have to play as a fluid, cohesive unit and take our chances when they come because we need goals and cannot afford to give any away.\n#Final Thoughts + Toronto Predictions I would love to see a huge win today, and even more to see Denkey get a goal (or more). I am going to predict a 3-1 FCC win with a Denkey brace and a wildcard Yedlin goal. As always, thanks for reading, and cheers! ALL FOR CINCY!"

    "text": "What’s up?\nThis breakdown will take a look at orange and blue’s home opener against NYRB. To begin, I want to discuss the non-footy things such as the new signings, buildup to the match, fan atmosphere, etc.\n\n\nNew Signings\nObviously, these two marque singings need no introduction. Kevin Denkey and Evander are players who are known for their class on the ball. Denkey scored 23 in 28 appearances in the 2023/24 season with his previous club, Cercle Brugge. Already this season, he has hit the ground running for the orange and blue netting 2 in 2 games. He is currently listed as +2500 to win the golden boot, which could be a huge under-estimation of his ability come the end of the season.\nEvander, like Denkey, is a player who is known to be great with more potential to grow as he is only 26 years old. He comes to Cincy with nice experience in the MLS and abroad, where he even played in the UEFA Champions League in his time at FC Midtjylland. Last season while playing for the Portland Timbers, he had 34 goal contributions which put him second to a little known player by the name of Lionel Messi (haha).\nAll this to say, both signings have started well. I look forward to seeing these two form chemistry as the season progresses. I also love that this ownership group has shown a willingness to invest and obtain the best players to help us push towards an MLS cup or Concacaf Champions League.\n#The Game Itself I was lucky enough to attend this game and before the game even began, the atmosphere was amazing. At the time of kickoff, the temperature was a cold 30-ish degrees but this did not tamper the fans, especially in the Bailey, even for a moment. The night began with an amazing firework display, where one of the techs even took a firework to the face (whom I hope is okay), and a nice tifo from the Bailey that read “Let the wild rumpus start”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, diving a bit into the tactics on the day, we saw FCC line up in a 5-3-2 that tends to shift in a sword type formation in an 5-3-1-1. As expected, the team looked a bit rusty in the first half especially and it was clear that the players haven’t quite gelled yet (as is expected this early in the season with a new number 10 and 9). Over the next few games, the team will continue to get used to see Evander dropping into the half spaces to link up play instead of looking for Lucho in that role. They will also adjust to Denkey up top and how to best utlilize his abilites. Early on in this game, Denkey recieved a through ball and nearly scored the first goal of the season but was ultimately stopped by the woodwork. He later found his breakthrough with a beautiful pass from Deandre Yedlin from around midfield which he headed precisely over Carlos Coronel.

Yes at times it was sloppy, the build up play was not as smooth as one would like to see, but it was the first game. As I stated above, gelling will take time especially with the abscence of the main conductor offensively for the past few years. However, I believe that Evander is more than capable of filling this role and forming an amazing partnership with Kevin Denkey. I am rushing to get this first report up before tomorrow’s game against Motagua and spent a majority of my spare time getting the site launched and creating a function to produce the plots above. That being said, I will produce more tables/plots showing off that previous games stats as I develop a nice workflow for these reports. # Next game prediction FC Cincinatti 3 - Motagua 1, Bring on Tigres!\n\n\nGoodbye!\nAs always, if you read this report, thanks so much for stoping by. All for Cincy!"
